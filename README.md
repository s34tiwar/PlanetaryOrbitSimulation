# PlanetaryOrbitSimulation
- Designed and implemented a Python-based planetary orbit simulation, utilizing real astronomical data and class-based programming to model accurate elliptical trajectories.
- Applied the SDLC Waterfall model to ensure structured project development, integrating UML diagrams for clear documentation and stakeholder communication.
- Engineered force calculations by breaking gravitational forces into x and y components, achieving realistic velocity updates and accurate orbit visualization.
